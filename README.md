# GameRig

GameRig is a so called feature set made for creating game engine compatible rigs using Blender's Rigify system.
It has been developed for use with Blender 2.92. Other versions might be compatible as well, this needs further testing.

> ## Usage instructions
> 
> Exactly the same as regular rigify but make sure to only use the rigs from that have the "game." prefix.
> Once you add a rig with the "game." prefix a new button will show up in the Rigify Buttons panel called Generate GameRig.
> Always use this button to build the game rigs.
